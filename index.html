<h4>Who We Are</h4>

<p class="font-120">Cascadia Analytics is a data science consulting firm based in the Pacific Northwest with a global focus.  We bring
two decades of experience in data engineering, statistical analysis, business intelligence, and agile software
development to help clients drive better business decisions with analytics.</p>

<h4>What Makes Us Different</h4>

<p class="font-110">Our strengths are a <a href="Philosophy.html">philosophy</a> through which we focus <em>first</em> on asking the right
questions to get at the core of the client's business challenge, then apply our <a href="Technologies.html">expertise</a> to create sustainable,
reliable analytics solutions that answer those questions.</p>

<p class="font-110">We are also firmly committed to giving back to the global community in which we live and work, through our contributions to open
source projects, and volunteering our time and skills to important causes.  Check out the <a href="BlogIndex.html">blog</a> for some examples
of our contributions.</p>
