  title: Analysis of Baltimore Policing Open Data
  excerpt: A two-part article with visualization and analysis of Baltimore's open data on arrests and calls for service.
---

<p>The City of Baltimore has, for some time now, made its "Part I" <a href="https://data.baltimorecity.gov/Public-Safety/BPD-Part-1-Victim-Based-Crime-Data/wsfq-mvij">Arrest</a>
  and <a href="https://data.baltimorecity.gov/Public-Safety/911-Calls-for-Service/xviu-ezkt">Calls-for-Service</a> data available on the city's
<a href="https://data.baltimorecity.gov/">Open Data Portal</a>. I thought it would be fun and interesting to dig into these datasets and see what I could produce in the way
of visualizations and analyses.  The result is a two-part article:

<ul>
  <li>Part I: <a href="/notebooks/Baltimore.nb.html">Visualization of Arrests in Baltimore</a></li>
  <li>Part II: <a href="/notebooks/BaltimoreCFSArrest.nb.html">Arrests and Calls for Service in Baltimore</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks to the City of Baltimore for its commitment to open data, and thanks to several friends and colleagues who provided valuable feedback on early drafts.  Enjoy!</p>
