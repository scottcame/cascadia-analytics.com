<p>Scott Came, Cascadia Analytics Principal, will give a lightning talk at the inaugural
<a href="https://cascadiarconf.com/">Cascadia R Conference</a> in Portland, Oregon, on June 3.</p>

<p>In the five-minute session, Scott will show a technique he used in <a href="http://datafordemocracy.org/">Data for Democracy's</a>
<a href="https://github.com/Data4Democracy/election-transparency">Election Transparency</a>
initiative to use R spatial packages to create a best-fit mapping of Alaska election precincts to county equivalents
(boroughs and census areas) in Alaska.  The talk will demonstrate how it is relatively easy to perform powerful manipulations
of spatial objects in R, in order to enable data aggregations in cases where dimensional rollups are unavailable from
government sources.</p>

<p>We are excited to support the growth of the R user community in the Pacific Northwest, and look forward to seeing friends
and colleagues in Portland!</p>
