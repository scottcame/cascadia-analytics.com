<p>Scott's goal in creating the firm is to leverage his passions for machine learning, visualization, and software engineering to build innovative
decision-making tools for organizations seeking to make a difference in the world. </p>

<p>Scott began his career in the early 1990s munging unemployment insurance data in COBOL on an IBM mainframe, and using SAS
to create visualizations and run regressions to assess the effectiveness of states' training programs on employment and wage
outcomes.  He subsequently worked in areas as diverse as immigration, forest management, health care, and sport. He has recently focused on building custom
software solutions that put analytics in the hands of users to drive better business decisions and inform policy.</p>

<p>For much of the past decade, Scott has been working in justice and public safety, helping state and local governments be more efficient and effective through
use of information.  He and his team at <a href="http://search.org">SEARCH</a> and the <a href="http://ojbc.org">Open Justice Broker Consortium</a> have developed
an analytics platform that makes justice system information available for strategic decision-making. He has been active in encouraging the use of
open source software and the availability of open data in government across the United States.</p>
